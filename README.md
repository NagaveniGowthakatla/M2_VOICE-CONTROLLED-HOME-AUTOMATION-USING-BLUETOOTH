# M2_VOICE-CONTROLLED-HOME-AUTOMATION-USING-BLUETOOTH
## INTRUDUCTION:-
  ## In this tutorial, I have shown you how to make home automation system using your smartphone through Bluetooth. We can control our electrical appliances by Google voice reorganization tool also. I have designed an app for this particular project. You can make this system for your science projects or you can make it for your home.
## OBJECTIVES:-
  ## By using home automation, one can control one can control home appliances like light door fan AC etc. Home automation not only referred as the best technology, it also reduced human effort.The main objective of home automation using voice control is to help handicapped people and blind people.This paper puts forward the design of home automation based on Bluetooth using voice control.The design is based totally in bread board.
