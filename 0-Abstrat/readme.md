### Today, in 21st century, home automation plays an important role in human life. By using home automation, one can control home appliances like light door fan AC etc. Home automation not only referred as the best technology, it also reduced human effort .The main objective of home automation using voice control is to help handicappedpeople and blind people .This paper puts forward the design of home automation based on Bluetooth using voice control.The design is based totally in bread board. We use arduino, Bluetooth module, and few jumping wires and the connection is setup on the bread board. The home appliances are basically connected to the Bluetooth module (HC05) by which theappliances are connected. This bluetooth device is connected to the arduino which consists of codes and thus programmed.This presents the design of home automation that can monitor and control home appliances by staying at particular place and access them remotely without the help of other people. By using this system, our home automation works smartly by providing increased quality of life, and comforts to users. Keywords: Bluetooth Wireless Technology, Smartphones, Home Automation System, Arduino Uno, Android, Bluetooth Module.


* This project is about interfacing a bluetooth module with arduino and android mobile to activate lights and fan in a room using voice control.

* The communication between the cell phone  and the Arduino BT board is wireless.
