### ARDUINO:-
     
    The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. Simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

### BLUETOOTH:-

    For the communication between mobile phone and microcontroller Bluetooth module(HC-05) is used.HC-05 is low power 1.8V operation and is easy to use with Bluetooth SPP (serial port protocol). Serial port Bluetooth module have a Bluetooth 2.0+EDR (enhanced data rate), 3Mbps modulation with complete 2.4GHZ radio transceiver and baseband. Using Bluetooth profile and android platform architecture different type of Bluetooth applications can be developed.

### RELAY:-

     Relay is basically an electromagneti switchwhich can be turn on and off by an applying the voltage across its contacts.

    â€¢ In this project used a 5V 2-channel relay.

### ANDROID:-
    
*  Android is an open-source operating system which means that any manufacturer can use it in their phones free of charge.

*  It was built to be truly open.

*  Android is built on the open Linux Kernel. Furthermore, it utilizes a custom JAVA virtual machine that was designed to optimize memory and hardware resources in a mobile environment.

### ANDROID APPLICATION OPERATED BLUETOOTH:-

* The Android platform includes support for the Bluetooth network stack, which allows a device to wirelessly exchange data with other Bluetooth devices.

*  The application framework provides access to the Bluetooth functionality through the Android Bluetooth APIs.

 ## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:-

* ### ARDUINO IDE

* ### AMR VIDEO ARDUINO IDE  
    ### It is the software for Arduino. It is a text editor like a notepad with different features. It is used for writing code, compiling the code to check if any errors are there and uploading the code to the Arduino.
