## OBJECTIVES:-
### By using home automation, one can control one can control home appliances like light door fan AC etc. Home automation not only referred as the best technology, it also reduced human effort.The main objective of home automation using voice control is to help handicapped people and blind people.This paper puts forward the design of home automation based on Bluetooth using voice control.The design is based totally in bread board.
 ## FUTURE EXPANSIONS:-
### Using this system as framework, the system can be expanded to include various other options which could include home securityfeature like capturing the photo of a person moving around the house and storing it onto the cloud. It will reduce the data storagethan using the CCTV camera which will record all the time by storing it. The system can be expanded for energy monitoring, orweather stations. This kind of a system with respective changes can be implemented in the hospitals fordisable people or in industrieswhere human invasion is impossible or dangerous, and it can also be implemented for environmental monitoring.


## ADVANTAGES:-
### In recent years, wireless systems like Wi-Fi have become more and more common in home networking. In home and buildingautomation systems, the use of wireless technologies gives several advantages that could not be achieved using a wired networkonly. They are:-
* ### Reduced installation costs: First and foremost, installation costs are significantly reduced since no cabling is necessary. Wiredsolutions require cabling, where material as well as theprofessional laying of cables (e.g. into walls) is expensive.
* ###  System scalability and easy extension: Deploying a wireless network is especially advantageous when, due to new or changedrequirements, extension of the network is necessary.
## DISADVANTAGES:-
### Disadvantages •Bluetooth is used in this home automation system, which have a range of 10 to 20 meters so the control cannot be achieved from outside this range. •Application is connected after disconnect of the Bluetooth.

## CONCLUSION:-
### The home automation using Internet of Things has been experimentally proven to work satisfactorily by connecting simpleappliances to it and all the applianceswere successfully controlled remotely through internet. The designed system not only monitorsthe sensor data, like temperature, gas, light, motion sensors,but also actuates a process according to the requirement, for exampleswitching on the light when it gets dark. It also stores the sensor parameters in the cloud as well as Gmail in a timely manner. Thiswill helpthe user to analyze the condition of various parameters in the home anytime anywhere.
